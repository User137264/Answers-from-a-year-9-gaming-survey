<p>This shows that the majority of year 9's think video games have a mostly positive or very slightly negative effect on the player, as 5, which is just below half way, which would be 5.5 (which wasn't an option), has the most votes at 7 votes, and there are 22 votes for higher numbers, but only 2 for lower numbers. One of my questions was in general, are video games seen positively or negatively, my survey showed positively to be the answer, so I checked online.
I found online that there are a lot of mixed opinions and that it is a quite controversial subject.</p>
