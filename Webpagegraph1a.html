<p>This shows that the majority of year 9's who play video-games (they were only asked the question if they said they did) also play games that were above the age rating group they were in. I found some graphs on a similar question, not on the age ranges played, but the people playing, and found that most sources agree that at least 15% of gamers are below the age of 18. Some even suggested greater figures. I found everyone I asked said they played video games, and I found that approximately 30% of the worlds population is under 18. This suggest most under 18's play video-games unless they cannot afford to. The below image shows some of the mentioned statistics on age.</p><br/>
